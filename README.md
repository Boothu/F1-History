This is a basic webpage that I will update regularly to practice web programming.

## Installation
Simply download files, and run html files, and website will display correctly. Ensure everything remains in the same directory.

There are 3 different HTML files - one for the homepage and two individual team pages.

There is an external CSS stylesheet.

There are 11 images in png format.

There is a test file for testing features which don't fit with the websites theme.

There is JSON integrated into test including drivers details.

Local Storage has been used so you don't have to type your name in multiple times.
