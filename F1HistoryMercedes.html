                <li>Mercedes-Benz made its Formula 1 debut in 1954 as a factory team with drivers Juan Manuel Fangio and

                <li>Mercedes-Benz withdrew from Formula 1 after the 1955 season due to a tragic accident at the 1955 Le
                    Mans race.</li>
                <li>They focused on other motorsport endeavors before making a partial return as an engine supplier in
                    the 1990s.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

            <h3>Return and Golden Years (2010-2019)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>In 2010, Mercedes-Benz returned as a factory team, rebranded as Mercedes Grand Prix (later
