        <h4>1954-Present</h4>
        <p>Mercedes-Benz, a German automaker, has a storied history in Formula 1. Here's a concise overview:</p>

        <section>
            <h3>Formation and Early Years (1954-1955)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Mercedes-Benz made its Formula 1 debut in 1954 as a factory team with drivers Juan Manuel Fangio and
                    Karl Kling.</li>
                <li>In their inaugural season, Fangio won the Drivers' Championship, and Mercedes-Benz secured the
                    Constructors' Championship.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>Withdrawal (1956-2000)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Mercedes-Benz withdrew from Formula 1 after the 1955 season due to a tragic accident at the 1955 Le
                    Mans race.</li>
                <li>They focused on other motorsport endeavors before making a partial return as an engine supplier in
                    the 1990s.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>Return and Golden Years (2010-2019)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>In 2010, Mercedes-Benz returned as a factory team, rebranded as Mercedes Grand Prix (later
                    Mercedes-AMG Petronas Formula One Team).</li>
                <li>They struggled initially but made progress, especially after signing Lewis Hamilton in 2013.</li>
                <li>Mercedes dominated the hybrid era, winning 7 Drivers' and 8 Constructors' Championships.</li>
            </ul>

        <section>
            <h3>The End of Dominance (2020-Present)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Mercedes-AMG Petronas continued its success in the 2020 Season with Lewis Hamilton and Valtteri
                    Bottas as drivers.</li>
                <li>Their 7 year reign came to a halt when Max Verstappen won the 2021 WDC in a controversial Abu Dhabi
                    GP, although Mercedes still won the WCC this year by a thin margin.</li>
                <li>Mercedes fully slipped out of prominence by the 2022 season, having only the 3rd fastest car,
                    although in 2023 they are putting a fight to Ferrari for 2nd fastest.</li>
            </ul>
